# Banner Schedule Exporter

This browser extension will pull data from your Banner course schedule and create an `.ics` file for you to import into a calendar app like Google Calendar, iCalender, etc. You can also remove courses you do not want to export in the preview page. **Works for all schools that use Banner!**
